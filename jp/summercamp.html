      Japanese Summer Language Camp</h2>
      <p class="style1"><em><strong>Description:</strong></em><br />
      The learning of a language, especially at the entry levels, requires continuous practice. The Summer vacation poses an obstacle to the learning process by creating a long break; often students come back to the learning after the vacation, only to struggle to recover the knowledge that they lost during the break. The Summer can, however, also offer an opportunity to a different kind of learning, allowing the lesson to take place outside a classroom. The basic idea of the Japanese Summer Language Camp is a) to give students a chance to use what they have learned in more realistic ways than mechanical exercises in a classroom, and b) to give intensity to the experience with the language by spending as much concrete amount of time as possible, so that the participants may learn the language through their body and the experience and that what they will have learned may survive the Summer vacation. With this Summer camp, students will spend 6 days (5 nights) in the place away from the city and surrounded by nature, and they will learn and communicate in Japanese from morning till evening as much as their knowledge will allow. There will be 2 different types of lessons at the camp: one is the basic Japanese grammar and vocabulary, and the other is the expression and vocabulary that are immediately useful for the communication at the camp. For the evening, we could relax watching Japanese films of various types (Japanese classics, contemporary films or animated films) and improve at the same time the Japanese listening skill.</p>
